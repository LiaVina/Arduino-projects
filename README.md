Hey, here are my simple codes for Arduino projects.
I am using the Arduino Upgraded Learning Kit by Modulosy.

Projects:
1. Car gate: using Keyboard, RGB Module, Servo Motor (SG90), UNO R3. Opens the gate after entering the correct password.
2. Photoresistor: using Photoresistor, LED diode, Button, Potentiometer (10K), Resistors (220Ohm for diode, 1KOhm for photoresistor). Measuring the brightness of the diode.
